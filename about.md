## About Lindsey Mysse

Hello! I'm Lindsey Mysse, a developer and creator with a passion for web technologies and open-source projects.

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It serves as a personal space to share my projects, ideas, and experiences.

### GitHub Pages and Jekyll

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages. Jekyll takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a complete static website based on layouts and themes.

Some key features of Jekyll used on this site include:

- **Markdown Support**: Content is written in easy-to-use Markdown
- **Theme Customization**: The site uses the Minima theme with customizations
- **GitHub Integration**: Changes are automatically published when pushed to GitHub
