UX for AI.

I am a multi-Webby winning prompt engineer, ux designer and web developer who has also worked in environmental design, interface and fine art. I have developed software solutions for everything from gestural interface for musical instruments to tech platforms for open source intelligence. Over the past 7 years I have focused exclusively on developing interfaces for machine learning applications.
