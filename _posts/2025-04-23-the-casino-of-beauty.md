[Download the Zine Here](/the-casino-of-beauty.pdf)


This zine was the result of a deep exploration of the possibilities of Generative Images done in 2022. It utilized the earliest models of Stable Diffusion. I wanted to call it "The Endless Sequel", but the business guys didn't like it. 

I still think AI generative art is its own new genre of art that possesses immense possibilities --  alas it now just produces advertisements and propaganda. 

This project also included building custom MIDI hardware to automatically generate AI images. It was a fascinating project, and I'd like to get back to the field soon.
