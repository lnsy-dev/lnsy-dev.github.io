I recently shipped a product in six weeks that was absolutely vibe-coded beginning to end. I thought it was wonderful.

How I vibe-code builds upon my decades of experience slinging web. When I think about what it was like to write HTML before there was such a thing as CSS and JavaScript and I think about what we have now I am more than impressed about the progress we have made. This includes the ease with which we can write and deploy software.

I think that vibe coding is a spectacular tool and I think everyone should do it. I think that we would have a lot better software ecosystem when there were a lot of CEOs and other business people who rather than dictate the software they want, simply sit down and do the hard work of thinking through the software.

I was talking to a venture capitalist on Monday and talking about the state of programming. And my impression coming from him was that a lot of venture capitalists are realizing that in fact, vibe coding cannot replace programmers. Vibe coding, in fact, is going to create more programming jobs. 

In the end, the hard part about software is thinking through the problem you are trying to solve with software. 

I have found working with Cursor to be like working with the fastest, worst junior dev I have ever met. Capable of moving incredibly quickly, Cursor will break your software just as quickly. Things that worked two or three iterations ago are now broken along with a large amount of other items in your code base. In the end, you have to become a good manager of programmers and Cursor as one of your programmers first.
