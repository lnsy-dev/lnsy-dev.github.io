[Find the code here](https://github.com/lnsy-dev/vanilla-webpack-boilerplate)

Modern Web development has gotten far too complex. Frameworks and ornate build systems have obscured the fact that the fundamentals of JS and CSS have gotten not just slightly better but really, really good.

This project is for people who want to write passionate code and ship it quickly.

It's great for building and publishing custom HTML components. It already has WebWorkers built in.
