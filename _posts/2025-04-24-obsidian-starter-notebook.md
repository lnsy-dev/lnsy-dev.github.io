This project is obsolete these days -- count this as a stub for future development. 

I love Obsidian Notes -- as slow and cranky as they are. I normally whine when I have to open an Electron app, but Obsidian's utility and beauty keeps me coming back. Highly customizable, beautifully designed, I am struck at how "just enough" code they write. It is a joy to edit markdown in it, though its search and indexing functions struggle with the 100000+ files I have in my main notebook. 

I have since written extensive plugins for Obsidian that really only work for me. I have tried to pitch this code to others, but for the most part the concepts and commands are hermetically sealed within my mind. My setup gets comparisons to Project Xanadu, though I don't think in a complementary way. I started writing a manual for basic usage of my Obsidian notes setup and it turned into a 10,000 word monstrosity. 

Since I did this project lots of things have changed in Obsidian. 

Obsidian now has a web clipper: https://obsidian.md/clipper that is far more friendly to use than Omnivore. I wrote my own AI integration that works well for me but requires a lot of setup (and probably needs to be re-written with the new technology changes anyway).

My ultimate dream is that the people who wrote Sublime Text will do a note taking app that I can use with basically the same features as Obsidian -- just written like Sublime. 

Still, shout out to Obsidian.
